# Architecture

Target iOS 26 / Swift 6 / Metal 4 design for the camera-to-ML pipeline, derived from
`domain-revised/` and `ios-platform-guide/`. This directory contains nine concern files,
four register files, and a compiling Swift skeleton.

---

## Primary-owner rule

> Every architectural decision has exactly one primary-owner file. Cross-references in other
> concern files must be labeled `(see X#anchor for the authoritative statement)` and must
> not repeat decision content.

## Reading order

New readers start with §Interactions considered below, then read concern files in this order:

1. `01-system-shape.md` — where every type lives; most cited.
2. `02-concurrency.md` — invariant → primitive mapping; scenePhase / error / consumer sequences.
3. `03-camera-session.md` — `AVCaptureSession` config, orientation, interruptions, self-healing.
4. `04-metal-pipeline.md` — per-frame command graph, pools, readback.
5. `05-consumers.md` — `PixelSink` registry, Swift ↔ C++ interop, observability.
6. `06-capture-and-recording.md` — still capture (TIFF) + HEVC recording (MP4).
7. `07-settings.md` — merge, ISO/exposure coupling, persistence, heartbeat.
8. `08-ui.md` — SwiftUI composition, controls, scenePhase wiring.
9. `09-errors-and-recovery.md` — error taxonomy, recovery state machine, watchdogs.

Register files:

- `api-surface.md` — prose summary of the SDK boundary; points into `api-skeletons/`.
- `decisions.md` — `D-##` roster; consequential entries have full ADR-form anchors in their
  owning concern file.
- `constants.md` — load-bearing numeric values. Every cell populated.
- `open-questions.md` — deferred U-## items + architecture-originated open questions.
- `api-skeletons/` — SwiftPM package (`swift build --package-path api-skeletons/` must
  succeed under Swift 6 + strict concurrency).

## Interactions considered

Six cross-subsystem interactions surfaced during design. Each bullet carries one of the
allowed shape tags — `concurrency×lifecycle`, `storage×consumer`, `error×recovery`,
`resource×teardown`, `settings×session`, `ui×state` — per the M8 gate.

- **concurrency×lifecycle**: scenePhase `.inactive` × outstanding `MTLCommandBuffer` →
  `constants.md#FRAME_LATENCY_BUDGET_MS` window. The GPU submission gate (ADR-09 +
  `02-concurrency.md` §Sequence A) is a `ManagedAtomic<Bool>` checked after CPU-side work
  and immediately before `commit()`. `lastCommittedCommandBuffer?.waitUntilScheduled()`
  runs on the engine actor once the gate is set. D-06 commits the strict `.inactive` policy
  — even a notification banner blacks out the preview. Shape: `concurrency×lifecycle`.
- **storage×consumer**: D-02 (`.shared` start-simple default) × D-12 (natural stream
  subscribable) × ADR-20 graduation criterion. With `.shared` from Stage 01, consumer
  attach is a no-op on the Metal side — the sequence is the empty sequence. Graduation to
  dynamic `.private` → `.shared` rotation is the only path where G-25's silent-drop-on-
  `.private` failure mode applies; it is deferred to a MIGRATION stage per
  `open-questions.md` §OQ-01. Shape: `storage×consumer`.
- **error×recovery**: `CAPTURE_FAILURE` × exponential backoff × watchdog disarm order
  (D-13, Inv 12). Step 1 of recovery disarms both watchdogs before any state transition;
  Invariant 12 ensures a late-firing watchdog compares its captured session-token against
  the current one and no-ops. Without this ordering, a retry reopen can arm a fresh
  watchdog that collides with the prior watchdog's scheduled callback, producing a
  double-recovery. See `09-errors-and-recovery.md` §D-13. Shape: `error×recovery`.
- **resource×teardown**: `close()` × in-flight capture × pipeline-pointer guard (D-15,
  Inv 4). The Swift-side engine actor serializes `close()`; the C++-side `std::mutex`
  serializes the raw pointer access; the teardown ordering in `03-camera-session.md`
  §Full teardown releases GPU resources on the delivery queue context they were created
  from (Inv 2). A pure-Swift actor boundary would not suffice because the native pipeline
  pointer is accessible from external C++ callers who go through
  `getNativePipelineHandle()`. Shape: `resource×teardown`.
- **settings×session**: ISO + exposure coupling (Rules 1/2/3 in `07-settings.md` §ISO +
  exposure coupling) × `sessionQueue` config window × KVO state stream. After merge, the
  resolved pair is committed inside a single `lockForConfiguration()` window on
  `sessionQueue` via `setExposureModeCustom(durationNs:iso:)` — iOS's API shape structurally
  enforces coupling. Rule 3 (manual latches from last readback) depends on the
  `DeviceStateSnapshot` stream's most-recent value, updated via KVO per `02-concurrency.md`
  §KVO → AsyncStream adapter. Shape: `settings×session`.
- **ui×state**: `frameResultStream` × `focusDistance == nil` × UI scanning indicator. The
  UI binds `liveFrameResult.focusDistance` directly; the domain specifies `nil` whenever
  the autofocus is actively scanning (domain 09 §FrameResult Display). A scanning animation
  replaces the numeric value while `nil`. The nil-vs-numeric transition is a state-shape
  dependency — UI code must handle both without showing stale values. Shape: `ui×state`.

## Phase coverage table

Maps `domain-revised/NN-*.md` files to primary concern(s) and implementing stage(s). Stage
numbers reference `../stages/stage-index.md`.

## Mechanical verification

Pre-Agent-4 gate:

```
./implementation/scripts/verify-architecture.sh implementation/
```

Checks M1–M8 defined in the implementation pipeline spec. Failures must be fixed before
Agent 4 runs.

---

## Swift skeleton

```
swift build --package-path implementation/architecture/api-skeletons/
```

Exits 0 under Swift 6 language mode + strict concurrency. Every public type named in
`api-surface.md` has a stub body of `fatalError("Stage N")`; the stage number identifies
where the real implementation lands per `../stages/stage-index.md`.
